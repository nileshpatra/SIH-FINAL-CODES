# Dream Slayers
This was the hackathon project made by Team Dream Slayers during smart india hackathon , 2019 .
## Functionality

> Machine learning model for predicting optimal velocity to avoid collision.

> ML model deployed at server https://alertme123.herokuapp.com/api 

> Android App (AlertMe) providing functionality: notification when in high danger zone,demarcating areas on map accoring to accidents  data , performing a HTTP POST request to the server to make predictions.

> An alternative mathematical model taking into consideration distance vectors , velocity vectors and their dot products with GUI simulation using tkinter and matplotlib. 

> Adaptive headlight model simulated using PyGame. 

> You can check the pdfs included for complete details.
